# dart-beers

This project was created to learn Dart basics, as well as common use cases from other languages I use on a daily basis. I'll be recording my experiments and what I've learned while treking through Dart.

## Experiments

* [ ] Create a local package, module, or library and utilize it in our entry point.
* [ ] Leverage go package manager for 3rd party packages.
* [ ] Read from a file in a local directory.
* [ ] Create a basic DTO (data transfer object).
* [ ] Marshal and unmarshal DTO to string and Dart structure.
* [ ] Expose REST endpoints for the experiment application.
* [ ] Create a service description for my REST endpoints, following the HATEOAS model.
* [ ] Handle multiple different HTTP verbs.
* [ ] Handle and manipulate different media types.
* [ ] Experiment with decorators for simplifying common REST features.
* [ ] Dockerize application (include 3rd party packages).
* [ ] Create unit tests and execute on a CI/CD platform.
